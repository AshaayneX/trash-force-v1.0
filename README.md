<h1>TRASHFORCE V 1.0</h1>

Trash force is a game developed in Unity and the aim of the game is to defend the satellites from incoming debris by hitting them with a laser which inturn deorbits them to burn up in the atmosphere.

the game has been made mathematically and astronomically accurate as possible in the given time frame, with the orbital dynamics of the debris simulated with Keplerian orbital propagators

We have added and spread out satellites and loaded them with their respective Two Line Element data which we obtained from the spacebirds.json file,
To make it more immersive and fun for the player, We have added space monuments like the moon and the International space station.

Although the game is just a simulation as of the time being, We hope to add missions and scores to make it more fun for the user in the future.
